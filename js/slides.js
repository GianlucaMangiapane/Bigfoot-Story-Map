    title: "So what exactly is a Bigfoot?",
    content: `
      Bigfoot is **Cryptid**, or an "animal that's been claimed to exist but there is no proven fact it exists",
      similar to the "Loch Ness Monster" or available office hours slots. Large, hairy, human-like Ape creatures have been
      reported throughout human time and place, either called **Sasqutch** in North America, the **Yeti** in Tibet/Nepal, the **Yeren** in China,
      and the **Skunk Ape** in the American South.

      Skeptics claim sightings are either partially visible animals or humans in costumes,
      but today we will go through some famous sightings, and you can be the judge.

      and weighing around 400 pounds. Locals dispute this happened though since no video was uploaded to Worldstar.

      Arguably the most famous and influential Bigfoot video is the 1967 film shot
      by Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin in Northern California, making Bigfoot a movie star.
      Although some delusional viewers believe it to be an actor in a gorilla costume,
      this film never got nominated for an award so must not be a very good actor.
